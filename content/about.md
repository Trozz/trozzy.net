### Who are you?

My name is Michael Leer, I decided to start a blog as a place to note down some of my thoughts and some of the work that I do. I've been a Linux user and systems administrator for over a decade, along the way there have been numerous influential individuals who have taught me best practices, problem solving skill and patience, I look at this new blog as a way to give back to the community that has helped me over the years and to help the next generation that are still learning.

### What's your background?
Technology has been something that has always captivated me, when I was very young my parents bought my first computer, it didn't last very long... but thats another story, many years later I would design websites (I used design lightly) and gradually moved to providing services for others such as web hosting and consultancy.

I have been working with Linux professionally since 2006 but was a avid user before that.

### What are you currently doing?
Currently I am working with a hosting startup based north of London that is specilizing in providing secure cloud environments, in recent history I have worked at both [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and [Rackspace UK](https://www.rackspace.co.uk/)

Outside of my day to day I have contributed to [Mattermost](https://www.mattermost.org/) and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
